# CS360-Mobile-Dev-Portfolio-Piece

    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was designed for users who want to track their weight and goals over time.  The user should have privacy behind a login screen, should be able to add a new weight or goal weight, view their previous weights, and edit or delete previous weights.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were two screens necessary for this app: the login screen and the weights screen.  Both screens used a simple interface with clear calls to action.  Only a few buttons were present on each screen to support this.  Important information and features are shown first on the screen and backed with a bold and contrasting color-scheme.  Less important information is displayed below that with a lighter color-scheme.

    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached coding my app by fulfilling individual user stories.  Stories were broken down into their constituent parts and completed in the order of their dependencies.  This has been a generally successful strategy for me -- breaking a process down into steps then completing each milestone -- and I expect it to continue to be so in the future.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my app by trying to break each feature as I implemented it.  When I the feature was stable enough that I could no longer break it, I would move forward.  This process ultimately failed because I created unintended dependencies in the code, which caused components I considered to be "complete" to later break.  Thurough testing is important to create stable application that users have confidence in.
    
    Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
 
I was under a large time constraint while I was doing the coding for this project.  To give myself enought time to implement as many features as possible, I had to fit the coding paradigms I was already familiar with to my needs rather than learning an entirely new set of tools.  One example of this was fitting a view-model-controller paradigm to control the main screen instead of loading in a plethora of fragments.  
    
    In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel that I showed excellence in creating behaviours for most of my button behaviors.  The behaviors were well encapsulated and had clear responsibilities.  I was also proud of the interface I designed for the main screen.  It was readable and the function of every component was clear.
